Work Day Scheduler is a simple scheduling program.  Users can store todo events for specific hours of the work day.  Each hour is color coded indicating if the time of day is in the past, the current hour, or in the future.

##  What's under the hood?

This small project has focused on the usage of Web API's to interact with the DOM, and Third Party API's to add convienient and stylish functionality to the project.  

### Web API's

* Event listeners (event delegation)
* Creating dynamic HTML through Javascript
* Usage of "event" within the DOM
* Data persistence through local storage

### Third Party API's

* Bootstrap
*  Moment.js

Bootstrap provided quick and polished CSS solutions, while Moment.js provided a means for displaying and comparing time in a specific format.  Despite Moment.js not being a supported API anymore, by using it as well as Bootstrap, I gained experience in researching API documentation to successfully implement a third party application into my project.

## Conclusions

I felt a sense of pride completeing this project, in the sense that my code came togethor more easily, and reads better as well.  Before I wrote any Javascript, I psuedo coded the logic by typing what I wanted to accomplish.  I want to write a funciton which does this...  In doing so, I was able to define every function I wanted to code prior to any coding, with the exception of one.  That particular funciton, accessing local storage if local storage exists, I was able to add on the fly.
